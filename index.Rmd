## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
hls2 <- read.csv("data_pre.csv", header = T)
str(hls2)

hls2 <- hls2[2:45]

hls2[hls2 =="2"]<- 1
hls2[hls2 =="3"]<- 2
hls2[hls2 =="4"]<- 3
hls2[hls2 =="5"]<- 4


```

```{r tars}
mod2 <- tam(hls2)
summary(mod2)



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

plot(mod2, type = "items")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
